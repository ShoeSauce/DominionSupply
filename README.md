This project is a supply randomizer for the game Dominion. It let's the user specify which expansion sets, 
if any, the supply pile should be drawn from. It also let's the user set  minimum and maximum limits for
the number of cards to come from a given expansion. This is not done as input to the program but as hard-coded
changes to parameters in the code.

The number of cards chosen from a given set is determined with the mathematics of combinatorics. Pascal's Triangle (in
table form) is used to solve the combinatorics problem.
